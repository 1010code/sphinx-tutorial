# What is markdown ?  
According to Wikipedia :  

  >*Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.*   


`SIMPLY: IT'S JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF TEXT FILE, LIKE .txt .doc ....( now it's .md :laughing:) AND IT HAS SOME SPECIAL SYNTAX.`

*There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. This has led to fragmentation as different vendors write their own variants of the language to correct flaws or add missing features.. A list of markdown flavour is available [here](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors).*

From now, this guide will mainly focus on Github Flavoured Markdown.

## Why use markdown?
Because it's :
 * **EZ** : The syntax is so easy that you can learn in a minute or two then write without noticing anything weirdo  or geeky.
 * **FAST** : It saves time compared to other types of text files/formats. It helps boost the productivity and workflows of writer.
 * **CLEAN** : Both the syntax and output are clean, not messy with our eyes and simple to manage.
 * **FLEXIBLE** : With just a little set-up, your text will be translated cross any platform out there, editable in any text-editing software and convertible to a wide array of formats.

**In short**, normal users will find it useful in any cases, especially when you are in need of something better than plain text but less functional than Microsoft Word.  
**For Developers**, if you are lazy to write HTML code , you will love markdown. **Moreover**, **Github** and many sites favor markdown for readme file of projects. That means you gonna meet markdown in your life one way or another.
